# Arduino-Based Toll Collection System üöóüí≥

An automated toll collection system using Arduino and RFID technology to enable seamless, contactless toll payments, reduce congestion, and improve traffic flow at toll plazas.

## üìñ About

This project employs an **Arduino Uno** microcontroller integrated with an **RFID reader (RC522)**, RFID tags/cards, a **servo motor** for gate control, **IR sensors** for vehicle detection, a **16x2 I2C LCD display** for status messages, and a **4x4 keypad** for manual recharge input. The system automatically identifies vehicles via RFID, processes toll payments, and controls the toll gate accordingly.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- **Automatic vehicle identification** using RFID tags/cards  
- **Real-time toll payment processing** with Arduino Uno  
- **Servo motor controlled gate** for opening/closing based on payment status  
- **IR sensors** to detect vehicle presence and trigger the process  
- **16x2 I2C LCD display** shows payment status (Access Granted / Access Denied)  
- **4x4 Keypad** for entering recharge amounts when balance is low  
- Organized wiring using a **PCB perfboard** for power distribution

## üöÄ How It Works

1. **Vehicle Detection:** IR sensor detects vehicle approaching the toll gate.  
2. **RFID Scan:** RFID reader scans the vehicle's RFID tag.  
3. **Verification:** Arduino checks the tag data and balance.  
4. **Gate Control:**  
   - If balance is sufficient, servo motor opens the gate; LCD shows "Access Granted."  
   - If balance is low or tag is invalid, gate remains closed; LCD shows "Access Denied."  
5. **Recharge:** Users can recharge their RFID card balance using the keypad if needed.  
6. **Traffic Flow:** After successful payment, the gate closes automatically after a delay, allowing smooth traffic flow.

## üîß Setup Instructions

1. **Hardware:** Connect all components as per the circuit diagram provided.  
2. **Software:**  
   - Open the `.ino` file in Arduino IDE.  
   - Install required libraries (`MFRC522`, `Servo`, `LiquidCrystal_I2C`, etc.).  
3. **Upload:** Select the Arduino Uno board and appropriate COM port, then upload the code.  
4. **Test:** Present RFID cards to the reader and observe gate operation and LCD messages. Use the keypad to recharge cards as needed.
